# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dots and Boxes: Strategy Edition.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

"Dots and Boxes: Strategy Edition" is a modified version of the 'Dot and Boxes' game, with different tiered line connectors, that can create one or two lines. A complete box gets a connector upgrade, and 3 boxes grant the ability to a free box or a steal.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project, "Dots and Boxes: Strategy Edition," is an enhanced version of the classic pen-and-paper game, offering a variety of features to elevate the gaming experience. It will be executed using the Pygame to create a graphical interface for the game. The key feature is that players will have access to two different levels of line connectors. The first level allows players to connect one line per turn, while the second level enables them to connect two lines in one turn, adding a layer of strategy to the gameplay. Upon completing three boxes, players will earn a free complete box that can be placed in an open spot or used to steal an opponent's box, providing strategic opportunities to gain an advantage. Users will be able to choose their preferred colors for dots, lines, and boxes, allowing for a personalized gaming experience. The game will offer different grid sizes to accommodate players' preferences and varying levels of difficulty, providing flexibility and replayability. Players will have the option to choose from multiple difficulty levels, catering to both casual and experienced gamers. The game will feature a single-player mode against a CPU with adjustable difficulty levels, as well as a same-computer multiplayer mode for interactive gameplay with friends and family.

The design and logic will be implemented using Python programming language with the Pygame library. This will involve defining the rules of gameplay, including line connections, box completion, and stealing mechanics. Pygame will be utilized to create a visually appealing graphical interface for the game, including the representation of dots, lines, and boxes, as well as customizable colors and diverse grid sizes. User interaction will be implemented to allow players to make moves, choose colors, select difficulty levels, and navigate through the game's menus and options. An AI opponent will be developed for single-player mode, with adjustable difficulty levels to provide a challenging gaming experience.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

	1. User interaction for making moves and choosing options.
	2. Two different levels of line connectors.
	3. Free box upon completing three boxes.
	4. Customizable colors for dots, lines, and boxes.
	5. Various grid sizes to choose from.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

	1. User interaction for making moves and choosing options.
	2. Two different levels of line connectors.
	3. Strategic box-stealing mechanics upon completing three boxes.
	4. Customizable colors for dots, lines, and boxes.
	5. Various grid sizes to choose from.
	6. Adjustable difficulty levels for single-player mode.
	8. Single-player mode against a CPU with adjustable difficulty.
	9. Sound effects for actions such as connecting lines and completing boxes.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps in the development of "Dots and Boxes: Strategy Edition," my next steps would involve familiarizing myself with the Pygame library and game development concepts. I'll probably begin by exploring Pygame's documentation and tutorials to understand its functionalities and how to implement basic game features such as drawing shapes, handling user input, and managing game states. Focussing on implementing specific features outlined in my project plan, such as multiple levels of line connectors and customizable colors. Additionally, I may need to research game design principles to ensure an engaging gameplay experience, particularly in terms of balancing difficulty levels and strategical mechanics like box stealing.
